In order to ensure the safety and structural stability of New York City buildings, owners must comply with Local Law 11 which requires inspections of building façades, balconies, and terraces which meet specific criteria.

<br/>Due to the almost 14,000 buildings that must comply with the [Façade Inspection Safety Program](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/safety/facade-inspection-safety-program-fisp-filing-instructions.page) (FISP), the inspection process is broken down into five-year “cycles”.  Cycle 7 was the last full cycle completed, spanning from 2010 to 2014.  DOB is currently on Cycle 8 which began in 2015.

<br/>During the inspection process, a Qualified Exterior Wall Inspector (QEWI) classifies a building’s façade conditions in one of the following ways:

* Safe: No problems and in good condition (OK)
* Safe With a Repair and Maintenance Program (SW)
* No Report Filed (NR)
* Unsafe: Problems/defects threaten public safety (UN)
* Ongoing Maintenance (OM) *Formerly used status*
* Precautionary (PR) *Formerly used status*

#### FAÇADE INSPECTION RESULTS

Approximately 87% of the Cycle 7 façade filings were classified as either “Safe” or “Safe with a Repair and Maintenance Program”.  The number of "Unsafe" filings increased by 250% from Cycle 6 to Cycle 7. Cycle 4 compliance filings are not easily compared to subsequent cycles since the status type included “Precautionary” and “Ongoing Maintenance” which were discontinued classifications. Cycle 8 is currently in progress through February 2019, therefore there is a large percentage of "No Report Filed" classifications.

### WHERE ARE THE SAFE AND UNSAFE FAÇADES IN NYC?

> #### *60% of the buildings that must comply with FISP are in Manhattan* 

The following map provides the location and other information on the filing status of each eligible façade during Cycle 7.

#### UNSAFE FAÇADE CLUSTER AT NYCHA AMSTERDAM HOUSES

Multiple seven-story buildings within the Amsterdam Houses on Amsterdam Avenue between 61st and 64th Streets in Manhattan were categorized as "Unsafe" in Cycle 7.

#### FAÇADE VIOLATIONS

DOB Façade Violations are issued for the following: *Failure to File a Façade Technical Report (NRF)* and *Failure to File an Amended Façade Technical Report*. The issuance of these violations has increased over the last two years as a result of owners not submitting the LL 11/98 technical report for their FISP cycle.

<br/>The top 2 ECB violations issued by DOB are for *Failure to Maintain Buildings Wall(s) or Appurtenances* and *Failure To Take Required Measures To Secure Public Safety - Unsafe Façade*. 

<br/>The same trend in compliance filings is seen with respect to façade violations. The majority of violations are issued in Manhattan. 

#### Facade Violations by Borough - 2010 to 2016

|    Borough    | # Violations | % Violations |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|   Manhattan   |     2812     |     51.3%    |
|     Bronx     |     1119     |     20.4%    |
|    Brooklyn   |      836     |     15.2%    |
|     Queens    |      683     |     12.5%    |
| Staten Island |      26      |     0.5%     |

### WHAT RECENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED?

Following the May 2015 façade failure, DOB implemented changes to its own procedures to increase façade enforcement. Among other changes, DOB:


* Established a new system to track all Local Law 11 inspection reports;
* Required that any building that fails to timely file an inspection report will have 180 days to submit the report -- if the landlord fails to do so, the City will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place safety sheds at the location at the landlord’s expense; and
* Mandated that any building that files a report indicating there are dangerous conditions will be given 180 days to correct these conditions. Again, if the landlord fails to do so, the City will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place safety sheds at the location at the landlord’s expense.


### HOW IS DOB HELPING CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FAÇADE COMPLIANCE FILING REQUIREMENTS?

#### DOB NOW: SAFETY

*New Electronic Filing Requirement for NYC façade Inspection Safety Program:*  Beginning September 2016, the New York City Department of Buildings required building owners, managers, and design professionals to use the new online portal **DOB NOW: Safety** to:


* Submit façade compliance filings and report unsafe façade activity
* Make payments
* View and search information related to your façade filings
* Upload documents
* View the status of a façade filing
* Receive emails at milestones throughout the filing process


### HOW WILL DOB IMPROVE FAÇADE SAFETY MONITORING?

#### GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
DOB is currently using GIS tools that allow users to create interactive queries and analyze spatial information from maps. Using GIS, DOB inspection staff can aggregate various datasets, historic maps, and field reports. The results can be used to develop risk profiles for specific buildings and identify mitigation strategies. DOB will also be able to publish web-based GIS maps which can be viewed by other agencies and the general public.
