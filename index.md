###Origins of Façade Inspection & Safety Program (FISP)

The recent death of a 2-year-old girl hit by a piece of masonry that dislodged from an eighth-story window sill underscored the importance of façade maintenance to public safety.  In 1979, a similar incident that  left a Barnard College student dead and prompted the enactment of New York City Local Law 10 of 1980, the first of a series of groundbreaking façade safety ordinances.

<br/>In 1997 and 1998 New York City experienced several highly publicized exterior wall failures. In response, New York City Local Law 11 of 1998 was passed by the City Council and signed by the Mayor in March of 1998. The new law, known as Local Law 11 of 1998, further expanded the requirements for inspection and maintenance of the façades of buildings greater than six stories in height.

<br/>Owners of all such buildings must have a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer inspect the entire building envelope, including walls facing the rear or sides of adjacent buildings. At least one complete inspection from ground level to roof level via a scaffold (or other observation platform) is also required. Following specific guidelines provided by the Department of Buildings, the professional must determine the condition of all walls and appurtenances and compare it to the condition reported in prior Local Law 10/11 reports.

<br/>In 2010, the program in its 7th Cycle was renamed to FISP (Façade Inspection Safety Program) and staggered filings were introduced. In 2013, the 7th Cycle required supplemental inspections of guardrails, balcony and fire escapes for structural stability and code compliance. 2015 opened the 8th Cycle of FISP and guardrails and handrail elements must be incorporated into the report.

<br/>The detailed inspection and reporting requirements, as well as additional law updates, are contained in NYC Construction Codes §28-302.1 and RCNY §103-04.

###LOCAL LAW 11 CYCLE REPORTS

####*As a built, densely populated urban environment, NYC includes approximately 1 million aging buildings.  13,126 must comply with FISP.*

To protect the public who live and work in New York City in and around its large population of buildings from falling pieces of façade. Owners of buildings in New York City greater than six stories are required to file reports every 5 years that list probable causes of deterioration, as well as timetables for repair. Buildings are classified as Safe, Unsafe, or Safe with a Repair and Maintenance Program (SWARMP).

####*49% of the total cycle 7 façade filings were filed as Safe*

###WHERE ARE THE UNSAFE BUILDINGS AROUND NYC?

60% of the buildings that must comply with FISP are in Manhattan. 8% of the citywide FISP filings were filed as "Unsafe".

###WHICH SECTIONS OF THE CITY RECEIVE THE MOST FAÇADE VIOLATIONS?

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://nycdob.github.io/Maps/Facade_Violations" frameborder="0"> </iframe>


DOB Façade Violations are issued for the following: Failure to File a Façade Technical Report (NRF) AND Failure to File an Amended Façade Technical Report.  

####RECENT ACTIONS

Following the May 2015 façade failure, DOB implemented changes to its own procedures to increase façade enforcement. Among other changes, DOB:


* Established a new system to track all Local Law 11 inspection reports;
* Required that any building that fails to timely file an inspection report will have 180 days to submit the report -- if the landlord fails to do so, the City will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place safety sheds at the location at the landlord’s expense; and
* Mandated that any building that files a report indicating there are dangerous conditions will be given 180 days to correct these conditions. Again, if the landlord fails to do so, the City will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place safety sheds at the location at the landlord’s expense.


###WHAT TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS HAS DOB IMPLEMENTED TO AID CUSTOMERS IN SUBMITTING FAÇADE COMPLIANCE FILINGS?

####DOB NOW: SAFETY

*New Electronic Filing Requirement for NYC façade Inspection Safety Program:*  Beginning September 2016, the New York City Department of Buildings required building owners, managers, and design professionals to use the new online portal, DOB NOW: Safety to:


* Submit façade compliance filings and report unsafe façade activity
* Make payments
* View and search information related to your façade filings
* Upload documents
* View the status of a façade filing
* Receive emails at milestones throughout the filing process


###WHAT IS DOB’s PLAN TO FURTHER MONITOR AND ENFORCE FAÇADE LEGISLATION?

####GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
DOB is currently using GIS tools that allow users to create interactive queries, analyze spatial information, from maps. Through GIS, DOB inspection staffs can aggregate various datasets, historic maps, and field reports, to develop risk profiles for specific buildings, and identify mitigation strategies. DOB will also be able to publish web-based GIS maps, which can be viewed by other agencies, and the general public.

####LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR)
LIDAR uses laser light to scan and map distances for surfaces. DOB is currently experimenting with truck mounted mobile light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems, which can scan façade surfaces with a high degree of accuracy. The data collected from these scans can be used to assess hazardous conditions, and to compare against previous inspection.
