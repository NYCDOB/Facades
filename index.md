In order to ensure the safety and structural stability of New York City buildings, owners must comply with Local Law 11/98 which requires inspections of building exterior walls and appurtenances of buildings which are greater than six stories in height. General information on façades as well as detailed instructions on façade compliance filings are available on the DOB Façades [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/safety/facades.page). 

<br/>To facilitate the owners of the more than 14,000 buildings who must submit a [Façade Inspection Safety Program](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/safety/facade-inspection-safety-program-fisp-filing-instructions.page) (FISP) compliance report, the inspection process is broken down into five-year “cycles”.  Cycle 7 was the last full cycle completed, ending in 2014.  DOB is currently in Cycle 8 which began in 2015.

<br/>Inspections are conducted by private qualified registered design professionals who are not DOB employees. The Qualified Exterior Wall Inspector (QEWI) inspects the properties and assigns the following categories

* Safe: No problems and in good condition (OK)
* Safe With a Repair and Maintenance Program (SWARP)
* Unsafe: Problems/defects threaten public safety (UN)

The following categories of inspection were discontinued in Cycle 4 and are no longer used:

* Ongoing Maintenance (OM)
* Precautionary (PR)

DOB categorizes a property as No Report Filed (NR) if no report was submitted. 


#### FAÇADE INSPECTION RESULTS

Approximately 87% of the Cycle 7 façade filings were classified as either “Safe” (OK) or “Safe with a Repair and Maintenance Program” (SWARP). Cycle 7 had a 5% increase in the number of total records compared to Cycle 6. Unsafe filings are carefully monitored by DOB. Cycle 8 is currently in progress, therefore there is a large percentage of “No Report Filed” classifications. The NR category will not be comparable for this group until the filing period ends in 2020.

### WHERE ARE THE SAFE AND UNSAFE FAÇADES IN NYC?

> #### *The 60% of buildings greater than six stories in height are located in Manhattan and therefore most of the façade filings are in Manhattan* 

The following map provides the location and other information on the filing status of each eligible façade during Cycle 7.

#### CYCLE 7 FISP CLASSIFICATIONS BY BOROUGH

#### FAÇADE VIOLATIONS

DOB FISP Violations are issued for the following: *Failure to File a Façade Technical Report (NRF)* and *Failure to File an Amended Façade Technical Report*. The issuance of these violations has increased over the last two years as a result of owners not submitting the LL 11/98 technical report for their FISP cycle.

<br/>The majority of ECB/OATH Violations issued by the DOB Façade Unit are for *Failure to Maintain Buildings Walls* and *Failure To Protect the Public*. 

<br/>The density of buildings greater than six stories in height is also reflected in ECB violation issuance by DOB Façade Unit. 

#### Facade Violations by Borough (2010 to 2016)

|    Borough    | # Violations | % Violations |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|   Manhattan   |     2812     |     51.3%    |
|     Bronx     |     1119     |     20.4%    |
|    Brooklyn   |      836     |     15.2%    |
|     Queens    |      683     |     12.5%    |
| Staten Island |      26      |     0.5%     |

### WHAT RECENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED?

DOB has launched significant improvements to its Façade Inspection Safety Program. Some of these changes include the following:


* Established a new system to track all Local Law 11/98 inspection reports (DOB NOW Safety);
* Proactive inspections on all FISP compliance filings including SAFE and SWARMP submissions;
* Any building that fails to timely file a compliance inspection report (NR), the Department will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place public protection at the location at the owner’s expense; and
* Mandated that any building that files a report indicating there are unsafe conditions will be given 90 days to correct these conditions.  The owner must install public protection as soon as an unsafe condition is discovered.  Again, if the landlord fails to do so, the City will conduct an inspection and, if needed, place public protection at the location at the landlord’s expense.


### HOW IS DOB HELPING CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FAÇADE COMPLIANCE FILING REQUIREMENTS?

#### DOB NOW: SAFETY

*New Electronic Filing Requirement for NYC façade Inspection Safety Program:*  Beginning September 2016, the New York City Department of Buildings required building owners, managers, and design professionals to use the new online portal **DOB NOW: Safety** to:


* Submit façade compliance filings including uploading documents
* Report unsafe façade conditions
* Make filing fee payment 
* View the status of a façade compliance filing
* View and search information related to façade filings and conditions
* Receive emails at milestones throughout the filing process


### HOW WILL DOB IMPROVE FAÇADE SAFETY MONITORING?

#### GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
DOB is currently using GIS tools that allow users to create interactive queries and analyze spatial information from maps. Using GIS, DOB inspection staff can aggregate various datasets, historic maps, and field reports. The results can be used to develop risk profiles for specific buildings and identify mitigation strategies. DOB will also be able to publish web-based GIS maps which can be viewed by other agencies and the general public.
